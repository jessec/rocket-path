	<p>
		A simple and lightweight tree structure library/API for building applications making use of such structures. <em>Rocket-Path</em>
		features a simple tree structure where nodes have <em>key-value-children</em> properties. The <em>key</em> and <em>value</em>
		can be any object, while <em>children</em> is a list of references to other tree nodes. The library also comes with
		three different approaches for building trees. All-in-all, aim of the library is to provide a simple and easy to learn
		and easy to use API for working with tree structures. The simplicity is achieved by externalizing both tree state
		management (nodes are immutable) and algorithms (no visitor-pattern directly required) from tree node values.
	</p>

	<h3>Main features</h3>

	<p>
		<em>Rocket-Path</em> library is oriented towards general tree construction/traversing. The feature-set, therefore, is
		intentionally small.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>A tree structure: {@link ws.rocket.path.TreeNode};</li>
		<li>Additional builders: {@link ws.rocket.path.builder.TreeNodeBuilder} and CDI annotations;</li>
		<li>A path string handler &ndash; helpful for traversing a tree: {@link ws.rocket.path.TreePath}.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Benefits of the Library</h3>

	<p>Benefits of using this library include the following:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>consistent and simple [semantic] tree structure for which traversing algorithms can be built;</li>
		<li>builders simplify creation of large trees;</li>
		<li><code>TreePath</code> simplifies tree traversal by parsing a path string, tracking the current position in
			path, and printing traversed/remaining path;</li>
		<li><code>TreeNode</code> is immutable and thread-safe &ndash; can be traversed by multiple threads;</li>
		<li>this library is kept as simple as possible; no tight coupling with the library needed.</li>
		<li>it's easy to visualize a tree dynamically at runtime rather than hard-coded objects &ndash; it improves
			debugging;</li>
		<li>traversing a tree is usually fast (depends on traversing algorithm) and cheap, yet it's more advanced than a
			hash map.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>General Usage Guide</h3>

	<p>Before writing any code, few things should be planned first:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>How is the tree structure going to be used?</strong> There are many things that a tree structure
			might represent: organization hierarchy, an application menu, virtual file system, decision branching, or any other
			specific categorization.</li>
		<li><strong>How to identify a node or nodes in the tree?</strong> There are actually many choices already
			developed, for example, file system path, XPath, ID-based lookup. Identifier should be preferably stored as the <em>key</em>
			of a node. The value types of <em>keys</em> should be known beforehand so that algorithms could handle them
			efficiently.</li>
		<li><strong>What are the actions that tree nodes could implement?</strong> More specifically, objects stored as
			tree node <em>values</em> could implement contracts (interfaces) that tree-traversing algorithms could invoke. For
			example, some objects in organization hierarchy could implement a <code>Manager</code> contract with its specific
			methods, a file system tree <em>values</em> could implement either a <code>Folder</code> or <code>File</code>
			contract.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Answers to these questions provide an input for creating interfaces (semantic contracts) to be used by <em>keys</em>
		and <em>values</em> of tree nodes. Of course, interfaces are optional and classes may be used instead, if it is more
		convenient. Please refer to the documentation of the packages for more information regarding how to use the features.
	</p>

	<h3>Dependencies</h3>

	<p>
		<em>Rocket-Path</em> library should be binary compatible with <strong>Java 1.6</strong> or newer runtime. Using
		annotations for tree construction assumes that a CDI implementation is available in the class-path and configured to
		be effective.
